'''Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote.
As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:â€¨

Election Results
-------------------------
Total Votes: 3521001
-------------------------
Khan: 63.000% (2218231)
Correy: 20.000% (704200)
Li: 14.000% (492940)
O'Tooley: 3.000% (105630)
-------------------------
Winner: Khan
-------------------------

In addition, your final script should both print the analysis 
to the terminal and export a text file with the results'''
